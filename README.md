## Overview  
Viruses evolve rapidly and pose major global health threats. Traditional lab-based methods for viral risk assessment and drug discovery are slow and costly. **ViroAlert** addresses this challenge by integrating **Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Generative Modeling** into a unified platform.  

The system enables:  
- Predicting whether a virus can infect humans.  
- Evaluating drugâ€“target interactions for antiviral candidates.  
- Generating new antiviral drug molecules.
